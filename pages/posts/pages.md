# Catchy Title

Okay so last night I had this idea,  after being harassed by arch users for using Windows 11. I finally decided it was time to make a change, so I did what I should have

Stay on with Windows 11.

### Why?

Well windows has been a daily driver for me since 2010 ( 12 years today wew ) and it has undoubtedly been the only realistic operating system in society. 

I have former experience with daily driving Ubuntu for about 2 years but it was jackass; 


Manjaro was a great distro but  it lacked some of the major software I used on Windows on a daily basis

### Idea

Coming back to my idea, my frontal lobe had this idea to port the good stuff from Arch to Windows. By good stuff, I mean the garbage people hoard up on r/unixporn. 

So we basically make Windows Alternatives to software like dmenu/rofi, polybar, window management, hotkey daemons, etc.

### Big Goal innit?

Yea it's a pretty easy thing to say but a pretty hard thing to do, if it was that easy there'd probably already be projects hoarding up on GitHub and indeed there are some projects that do similar. 


![PowerToys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/PowerToys/main/doc/images/overview/PT_hero_image.png)
[PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) for example does have stuff like window management and dmenu however it does not come aesthetically close to anything you've seen in those Arch Linux Rices'. In addition to that, it's made by **Microsoft** ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤® 



Other major software like Rainmeter turn out to be pretty heavy on the already bloated Windows 10/11, they don't appear to be an option for an average low end windows user.

### Proposal 

So I came up with Qubertz

The main idea is that Qubertz will be hosting several different projects; each of which will serve as a Windows alternative to a linux utility. I've done some research and planned out a lot of things ahead of time and if  I do not procrastinate (*[coughs](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/534761264967188500/934413849464029214/unknown.png)*) it might even be possible to pull out
